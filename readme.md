### What's This?

So it all started when I saw [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxpIj6vs) on Youtube program good ol' Snake in vanilla JS in 4 minutes and 30 seconds. The video is obviously made to entertain people and it seems rehearsed & practiced to me. (but good for him if he really wrote everything off the top of his head on the spot?)

After a day or two, when I felt like doing some hobby programming, I remembered this video and decided to write my own version just for the fun of it. 

PS: I've been coding for 10 years and it took me 1.5 hours to build this thing from scratch. At one point, I had to look up how to properly generate a random number in JS. The real coding process is not even close to what you see in that video :)
